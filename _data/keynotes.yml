    network collaboration, partnerships, communications and capacity development across this global data 
    and community. He arrived in GBIF having followed an unconventional career path beginning in journalism (including 20 years with the BBC),

    The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). 
    Tim has led the writing team of the third, fourth and fifth editions of the CBD's flagship Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) series. 
    In his present role, Tim leads the team engaging private sector and development actors in sharing biodiversity data through GBIF.
