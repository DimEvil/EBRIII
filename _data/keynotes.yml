    Nastasja Scholz coordinates the Horizon Europe Project BirdWatch since the beginning of 2023. Originally, she studied geophysics and was (and of course still is)
    interested in the quantification of geohazards. To avoid the potential fate of having to choose a career path in the energy industry, she took a detour by 
    entering the startup world where she learned about the capabilities of satellite remote sensing. This finally let her to join the LUP GmbH in 2021, where satellite data is used for 
    ecological, environmental and climate concerns, as exemplified by BirdWatch, a project quite close to her heart.
