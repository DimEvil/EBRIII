#Keynotes

**Mapping RI landscape: the role of Biodiversa+** **Rob Hendriks**

Biodiversa+, the European Biodiversity Partnership, aims at increasing the use of Research Infrastructures. In 2022-2023 a survey was conducted and a dialogue meeting held. 
This resulted in a report offering recommendations on how Biodiversa+ can facilitate the use of research infrastructures by biodiversity researchers. A brief presentation of 
these recommendations and of the results of the survey will be provided. One of the concrete recommendations is to have capacity-building workshops aimed at the research teams of the Biodiversa+ funded projects.

Also some other potential Biodiversa+ activities to help overcome barriers to the use of research infrastructures by biodiversity scientists in the European Research Area will be discussed. 
Priorities identified so far are: to help enhance the findability and (free) availability of data; to provide an overview of research infrastructures; to help lift the lack of coherence among 
research infrastructures and of long term commitments.

In early 2025 a follow up dialogue event with research infrastructures is foreseen which will feed the mid-term update of the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) of Biodiversa+.
