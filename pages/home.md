## Connecting Research to Policy

The Benelux Biodiversity Informatics community and partners are pleased to invite you to the Empowering Biodiversity Research conference, EBR III, taking place on **March 25-26th 2024 in Naturalis, Leiden, the Netherlands.** We will take you on a journey into the world of biodiversity data standards and tools and will inform you on the latest developments in the world of Biodiversity Informatics, both internationally and locally.

In 2024, we are taking a significant leap forward. Our primary focus will be on effectively **utilizing biodiversity data to bridge the gap with Policy**. We're determined to harness the potential of both local and international initiatives to drive progress. While you may already be acquainted with well-known entities such as GBIF, ELIXIR, Lifewatch, and DiSSCo, allow us to introduce you to MAMBO, ARISE, and Biodiversity Genomics Europe. Our comprehensive offering includes a carefully curated selection of keynotes, enlightening information sessions, impactful poster presentations, and, of course, a state-of-the-art Biodiversity Informatics market and reception.

Rest assured, your experience will surpass all expectations. 

For more info about the poster session, click [here.](https://dimevil.github.io/EBRIII/posters/)

The reception is foreseen on March 25th. It will give you the perfect opportunity to talk with your colleagues, friends on Biodiversity Informatics and what it could do for our research community.

For more information, please contact [Dimitri Brosens](dimitri.brosens@inbo.be), GBIF node Manager at the Belgian Biodiversity Platform.
