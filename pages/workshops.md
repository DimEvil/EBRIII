Here is the listing of workshops to be organised in connection to our conference. More information will be gradually added on these workshops. Workshops are organized by the EBR III organizing partners. 

## Workshop 1: Hacking biodiversity data cubes for policy
organized by Building BLocks for Biodiversity

B-Cubed’s hackathon is planned as a 4-day event, bringing together biodiversity informaticians, researchers, and practitioners who are passionate about leveraging biodiversity data for impactful solutions. Our common goal is to standardise biodiversity data in order to enhance efficiency and accessibility. The main idea is to experiment with data cubes and channel creativity into innovative solutions for a variety of biodiversity challenges.

We strongly encourage students to participate, bringing their fresh perspectives and knowledge to engage with data cubes and connect with leading experts in the field. The international B-Cubed hackathon is your opportunity to push boundaries and experiment with data cubes, while tackling an array of challenges.

## Workshop 2: Data publishing workshop on Zenodo and GBIF
organized by INBO (Dimitri Brosens & Lien Reyserhove)

This one day workshop focuses on optimizing data visibility through either Zenodo or the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Participants will delve into the features of Zenodo for seamless dataset sharing and discover the steps to publish datasets effectively on GBIF. Through hands-on exercises, attendees will gain practical skills to enhance the reach and impact of their research, aligning with the principles of open science and collaborative data dissemination.

The workshop underscores the principles of open science and collaborative data dissemination, positioning itself as a foundational experience for researchers new to data publication on both Zenodo and/or GBIF.

Date: June day: TBD <br/>
Time : 9:00 am - 4:00 pm <br />
Location :  VAC Herman Teirlinck; Havenlaan 88, 1000 Brussel Room: room TBC <br />
Number of participants:  max 20 <br />
Cost: FREE <br />
Lunch offered <br />

## Workshop 3: NLBIF Data Mobilization workshop
organized by NLBIF (Niels Raes & Jeroen Creuwels)

A day’s practical workshop on how to publish your biodiversity data via GBIF. Everyday a million new records are published at GBIF. In this workshop we see how we can attribute to get more biodiversity available. For this we will use the NLBIF-IPT and the biodiversity data standard DarwinCore.

In the morning we discuss the minimum requirements that the data must meet, and which metadata are required that describe the dataset. We will also show how to transform your data in the right format and how to overcome the obstacles with more complicated datasets. Finally, we show the options and benefits when the data is published at GBIF.

In the afternoon we will work with concrete datasets that participants bring along. Aided by a newly-written manual for this workshop, we try to get datasets actually published with GBIF by the end of the day.

Date: TBD <br />
Time: TBD <br />
Location: Naturalis Biodiversity Center <br />
Number of participants: max TBD <br />
